            <h3>Top Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <hr>
            <span>WHAT&#39;S INCLUDED THAT MAKES CRUISING A GREAT VALUE?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Your cruise fare includes accommodations, meals throughout the day including our 4 course dining rooms,
                24-hour room service, entertainment, and an endless array of activities, including newly launched Discovery
                at Sea programs like Stargazing, kids crafts and more! Plus, you won&#39;t have to pay for costly airfare, trains,
                or cabs to get you from one city to the next. When you take everything into consideration you will discover that
                you can actually save money by going on a cruise, as opposed to a land-based vacation.
                Additional fees may apply for services such as specialty restaurants, shore excursions, laundry, etc.

            <span>WILL I GET SEASICK?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Our larger ships are more stable with heavier weight and therefore are less prone to rolling motion.
                Most ships are so large and well-stabilized that it doesnt even feel like you are moving, especially
                in calmer waters such as Alaskas Inside Passage and the Caribbean. The middle of the ship tends have
                less motion, as it is the natural balance point.
                If you are prone to sea sickness, consider itineraries with fewer sea days. Port intensive cruises will
                give you the opportunity to spend more time on land. Consult your physician for a drug or alternative
                remedy if you are susceptible to motion sickness.

            <span>HOW DO GRATUITIES WORK?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                To simplify the tipping process for our passengers, a discretionary gratuity charge will be automatically
                added to your shipboard account on a daily basis. The daily gratuity amounts are $12 per person for
                mini-suites and suites, and $11.50 per passenger in all other staterooms per day (including children).
                Effective on voyages departing on or after January 1, 2016, the gratuity charge will be $13.95 per guest
                for mini-suites and suites, and $12.95 per guest for interior, oceanview, and balcony staterooms.
                This gratuity will be shared amongst those staff who have helped provide and support your cruise
                experience, including all waitstaff, stateroom stewards, buffet stewards, and housekeeping staff across
                the fleet. A 15% gratuity is added to bar charges and dining room wine accounts.

            <span>WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Casual sportswear, including shorts, lightweight pants and jogging suits, is the order of the day both
                at sea and ashore in hotter climates. We recommend you bring a sweater, a jacket or an all-weather coat
                for cool evenings, and for shore excursions, depending on your destination. You'll also want comfortable
                shoes for strolling on deck.
                For evening dining, keep with what you would wear to a nice restaurant at home: skirts/dresses, slacks,
                and sweaters for ladies, pants and open-neck shirts for men. Cruises five days or longer include at
                least one formal dining night: evening gowns and cocktail dresses for ladies and tuxedos, dinner jackets
                or dark suits for men.

            <span>IS CRUISING SAFE?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                1.7 million passengers sail with Princess annually. Your safety is our top priority. All of our onboard
                medical facilities meet or exceed the standards established by the American College of Emergency Physicians.
                Our onboard medical facilities are staffed by full-time registered doctors and nurses. In addition to
                twice-daily office hours, they are available 24 hours a day in the event of an emergency.
                All ships must follow rules and regulations to protect passengers' (and crewmembers') safety while onboard.
                The Coast Guard conducts quarterly inspections of all ships that operate from U.S. ports, making sure
                they comply with emergency-response requirements. Ships operate under international rules that regulate
                everything from fire safety to navigation and maritime security. We were the first in our industry to have
                a virtual training facility for our bridge crew, which we call the SeaSmart program. We also have voluntarily
                installed fire sprinklers in all cabins and balconies on all our ships.

            <span>ARE ALL PRINCESS SHIPS ALIKE?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Princess has everything from large ships carrying over 3,500 passengers to smaller, more intimate vessels
                accommodating just 680. Every vessel in our fleet is designed to give you plenty of room to yourself with
                spacious decks, comfortably elegant public spaces and inviting balcony staterooms. Yet each also creates
                wonderful opportunities to socialize with a variety of sensational activities and entertainment to suit
                your mood.

            <span>IS THERE PHONE AND INTERNET ACCESS?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Mobile phone service is available for use when the ship is at sea, in international waters, and in other areas
                where such use is permitted. All charges will be conveniently billed to you directly by your mobile device provider.
                Your mobile phone provider must have a roaming agreement with Maritime Communications Partner (MCP)or Wireless
                Maritime Services (WMS). Please contact your provider for more details on rates and availability.
                Internet access is available on all Princess vessels through our 24-hour onboard Internet Cafe and
                wireless network -- which is available in some staterooms and various public areas including our world famous Piazzas.

            <span>WILL I BE BORED?</span>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Only on Princess can you enjoy evenings spent watching Movies Under the Stars, with complimentary blankets
                and popcorn. Meet friends for a small bite, wine by the glass and enjoy street performer-style entertainment
                in the Piazza. Or spend a few hours of tranquility in The Sanctuary a retreat just for adults where you can
